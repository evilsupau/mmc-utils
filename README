MMC tools (mmc-utils)
=====================

mmc-utils is a tool for configuring MMC storage devices from userspace.

Contribution guidelines
-----------------------

The project works using a mailing list patch submission process, similar to the
process used for the Linux kernel itself.

One can document themselves by reading how to submit a patch in the official
Linux kernel documentation:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html

Not all sections apply but it should be a good way to get started.

A patch should be sent as a mail (not as an attachement, see documentation
above) to the linux-mmc@vger.kernel.org mailing list with maintainers as
Cc recipients.
